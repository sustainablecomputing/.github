# Optimized AI/ML Cloud Sustainability

This organization is focused on the optimization of the sustainability of AI/ML workloads in container clouds.
Optimization encompasses scaling and tuning of compute resources, in-cluster scheduling, multi-cluster dispatching, and load balancing.
Most projects in this organization build on the [Kepler project](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler) for monitoring power consumption of containers.

A high-level description of the projects is depicted below.
